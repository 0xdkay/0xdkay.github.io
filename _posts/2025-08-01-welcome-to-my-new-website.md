Welcome to my redesigned personal website!

## What is New

I have completely rebuilt my website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) to make it:

- **Easier to navigate** - Content is now organized into separate pages instead of one long scroll
- **Blog-ready** - I can now share technical posts, tutorials, and research updates
- **Talks section** - 20 presentations spanning 2013-2025 across 7 countries
- **Dark mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes based on your preference

## Site Structure

- **[About](/)** - Bio, highlights, and research interests
- **[CV](/cv/)** - Work experience, education, and awards
- **[Publications](/publications/)** - Research papers with media coverage
- **[Talks](/talks/)** - Conference and invited presentations
- **[Posts](/posts/)** - Technical posts and announcements
- **[Archives](/archives/)** - Chronological listing of all posts
