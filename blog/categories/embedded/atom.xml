    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many tools used for soldering/desoldering. I would like to introduce those tools today.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a id="solder_iron"></a> Soldering Iron</h2>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://www.rcsoup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/soldering_iron.jpg">http://www.rcsoup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/soldering_iron.jpg</a>" width="350" height="350"></p>

<p><strong>Soldering Iron</strong> is a tool used when you melt lead. For soldering and desoldering, soldering iron is basic tool which you will always use.</p>

<p>When you use soldering iron, you need to consider the temperature. If the temperature is too high, then you can easily melt lead and solder the components. However, because of the high temperature, other chips nearby could be damaged. Also, you need to take which tip you will use into account because the shape of tips is critical to heat conductivity. Therefore, you need to <strong>choose right temperature, and right tips</strong> for your target chip.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://www.howardelectronics.com/xytronic/Images/TipsLF.jpg">http://www.howardelectronics.com/xytronic/Images/TipsLF.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>There are several opinions related to the temperature of soldering iron, and most people recomment 315°C. You can see the discussion at the following link.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/1980/what-s-the-proper-soldering-iron-temperature-for-standard-031-60-40-solder"><code>What’s the proper soldering iron temperature for standard .031" 60/40 solder?</code></a></li>
</ul>


<p>Also, there is a post which makes your own tips for soldering iron using copper wire. You can see this at the following link.</p>

</ul>


<p>If the melted lead remains on the tip of soldering iron, it is really annoying when you solder a chip. Therefore, you need to clean the tips, and here is the tool, <strong>Tip Cleaner</strong></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://www.hakko.com/english/images/products/products_hakko_599b_img.jpg">http://www.hakko.com/english/images/products/products_hakko_599b_img.jpg</a>" width="400" height="400"></p>

<h2><a id="heat_gun"></a> Heat Gun</h2>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://i00.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/066/598/476/476598066_254.jpg">http://i00.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/066/598/476/476598066_254.jpg</a>" width="350" height="350"></p>

<p><strong>Heat Gun</strong> is a tool which blows hot air (similar temperature as soldring iron). While soldering iron melt lead on the surface touched by the tip, heat gun metls all lead at once. Therefore, it&rsquo;s really easy to desolder a chip using heat gun. However, there is disadvantage that because it melts all lead, <strong>other chips also can be detached from the board which is not intended</strong>. Also, the chips might be <strong>more damaged</strong> than soldering iron. Therefore, if you want to desolder a chip, then you need to consider carefully to choose the right tool between soldering iron and heat gun.</p>

<h2><a id="flux_helper"></a> Flux Pen &amp; Solder Paste</h2>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Flux_Pen.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Flux_Pen.jpg</a>" width="350" height="350"></p>

<p><strong>Flux Pen</strong> is a tool that when you want to solder a chip. These pens are usually made of rosin, which is based on real &lsquo;rosin&rsquo;. Rosin has good flux properties, a mixture of organic acids (resin acids, predominantly abietic acid, with pimaric acid, isopimaric acid, neoabietic acid, dihydroabietic acid, and dehydroabietic acid). Rosin is a glassy solid, virtually nonreactive and noncorrosive at normal temperature, but liquid, ionic and mildly reactive to metal oxides at molten state. Rosin tends to soften between 60-70 °C and is fully fluid at around 120 °C; molten rosin is weakly acidic and is able to dissolve thinner layers of surface oxides from copper without further additives. Therefore, If you just paint this pen at the target part and it&rsquo;s over, easy to solder. However, you need to <strong>clean up the leftover</strong> after you finished soldering because it could damage the circuit (short-circuit failure)</p>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Manufacturing_paste.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Manufacturing_paste.jpg</a>" width="350" height="350"></p>

<p><strong>Solder Paste</strong> is used to connect the leads of surface mount integrated chip packages to attachment points in the circuit patterns on a printed circuit board as flux pen. Different from flux pen, solder paste include lead itself as a component. Therefore, you can do <strong>lead-free soldering</strong>.</p>

<p>You can choose what to use between flux pen and solder paste as you prefer.</p>

<h2><a id="cleaner"></a> Desoldering braid &amp; Desolder Pump</h2>

<p><strong>Desoldering Braid</strong>, also known as <strong>desoldering wick</strong> or <strong>solder wick</strong>, is finely braided 18 to 42 AWG copper wire coated with rosin flux, usually supplied on a roll. You can absorb melted lead using this.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Solder_wick_rolled.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Solder_wick_rolled.jpg</a>" width="321" height="321">

<p><strong>Desoldering Pump</strong> , colloquially known as a <strong>solder sucker</strong>, is a manually-operated device which is used to remove solder from a printed circuit board. After melting target lead, you can suck up it.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Solder_sucker.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Solder_sucker.jpg</a>" width="400" height="400"></p>

<h2><a id="fume_extractor"></a> Fume Extractor</h2>

<p><strong>Fume Extractor</strong> is a tool that inhales the smoke of lead, which could be harmful. However, the suction power may not be enough, so you need to work closer.</p>

<h2><a id="fume_extractor"></a> In Summary</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about several tools that we can use in soldering and desoldering. There is only one thing that we should remember:</p>

    <id>http://insino.github.io/blog/2014/07/25/how-to-analyze-embedded-devices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday there was a post in the <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/samsung-gear-live-stock-firmware-image-pulled-temp-root/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a> saying that <a href="http://plus.adamoutler.com/">AdamOutler</a> again pulled out <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gear/gearlive_design.html"><em>Samsung Gear</em></a> live firmware image. He distributed custom kernel image and pulled images.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/07/25/gear.png"></p>

<p>Reading this article, I would like to sum-up the method to extract firmwares from embedded devices. So lets start.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a id="serial"></a> Serial Communication</h2>

<p>Before start, we need to know about the <em>Serial Communication</em>. There are many kinds of serial communication, and we will look through some famous and popular methods. Nowadays, many people are confused about the definition of serial communication. However, it&rsquo;s really easy as it is written.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Serial communication</strong> is the process of sending data one bit at a time</p></blockquote>

<p>As you can find that on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication">wikipedia</a>, we covers all the protocols that you might think. People usually think UART is the same as serial communication but it isn&rsquo;t. UART is just a kind of serial communication. Now have a look on different kinds.
Finding which interface is used by the device is quite tedious, that means you need to try all the methods using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer"><strong>Logic Analyzer</strong></a> or other connectors for each protocol.</p>

<h2><a id="uart"></a> UART</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2014/07/25/uart.JPG" width="250" height="250"></p>

<p><strong>UART</strong>, a short form of <em>Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter</em>, is a piece of computer hardware that translates data between parallel and serial forms. UARTs are commonly used in conjunction with communication standards such as EIA, RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485. The universal designation indicates that the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. The electric signaling levels and methods (such as differential signaling etc.) are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART.</p>

<p>For the convenience of debugging the devices, embedded devices often have debug ports with UART. When you put RX/TX part of UART connector, then you can easily see the debugging messages through it. The device on the right is one kind of UART-to-USB connector from FTDI, and you can connect to it via Serial.
Just put this device and download the drivers from <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232R.htm"><em>FTDI</em></a>, then it&rsquo;s done! Below video is AdamOutler&rsquo;s finding UART interface in Samsung Gear. You can find UART interface as this video putting RX/TX pins to the device.</p>

<h2><a id="jtag"></a> JTAG</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2014/07/25/olimex.JPG" width="250" height="250"></p>

<p><strong>JTAG</strong>, a short form of <em>Joint Test Action Group</em>, is the common name for the IEEE 1149.1 Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture. It was initially devised by electronic engineers for testing printed circuit boards using boundary scan and is still widely used for this application.</p>

<p>With JTAG interface, you can attach debuggers to it. For example, GDB can be attached to your JTAG. There are several researches related to firmware analysis to find malwares on embedded devices.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.syssec-project.eu/m/page-media/3/ndss14_zaddach.pdf">Avatar: A Framework to Support Dynamic Security Analysis of Embedded Systems’ Firmwares, Jonas Zaddach et al.</a>, utilized JTAG to perform symbolic execution with real-time environments.</li>
</ul>


<p>The device on the right image is <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-OCD/"><em>Olimex</em></a>. With this device, you can utilize OpenOCD which is a open source based JTAG implementation. You can follow instructions in this link for ARM Cortex M3.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.downloads.seng.de/HowTo_ToolChain_STM32_Ubuntu.pdf"><code>http://www.downloads.seng.de/HowTo_ToolChain_STM32_Ubuntu.pdf</code></a></li>
</ul>


<p>As default, it uses 3333 port for GDB attachment, and 4444 port for telnet based debugging interface. To start, just type:</p>

<p>``` sh
$ /bin/openocd -f [module.cfg] -f [target.cfg]</p>

<pre><code>#module configuration files are in 'openOCD/share/openocd/scripts/interface'
#target configuration files are in 'openOCD/share/openocd/scripts/target
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>To attach GDB,</p>

<p><code>sh
$ target remote localhost:3333
$ monitor halt                    # halts at current instruction, and shows registers
$ monitor resume                  # resumes the program
</code></p>

<p>There exists two modes in JTAG, so you need to select proper one for your purpose.</p>

<ol>
<li>ARM Debug Mode &ndash; usually to connect jtag as above.</li>
<li>Boundary Scan Cell Mode &ndash; to check the connectivity between chips</li>
</ol>


<p>JTAG also can be chained as below, you should be careful when you follow TDI/TDO wires from the processor.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://program-paralel-pk2.konsultan-pendidikan-tinggi.biz/_buku_manual/_baca_blob.php?book=lain&amp;td=1&amp;kodegb=654px-Jtag_chain.png">http://program-paralel-pk2.konsultan-pendidikan-tinggi.biz/_buku_manual/_baca_blob.php?book=lain&amp;td=1&amp;kodegb=654px-Jtag_chain.png</a>"></p>

<h2><a id="swd"></a> SWD</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2014/07/25/jlink.JPG" width="350" height="350"></p>

<p><strong>SWD</strong>, a short form of <em>Serial Wire Debug</em>, is a 2-pin electrical alternative JTAG interface that has the same JTAG protocol on top. It uses the existing GND connection. SWD uses an ARM CPU standard bi-directional wire protocol, defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5. This enables the debugger to become another AMBA bus master for access to system memory and peripheral or debug registers. Data rate is up to 4 Mbytes/sec at 50 MHz. SWD also has built-in error detection. On JTAG devices with SWD capability, the TMS and TCK are used as SWDIO and SWCLK signals, providing for dual-mode programmers.</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://www.segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html"><em>Jlink</em></a> in the right picture, you can use both JTAG and SWD interface. Also, you can get pin alignment in the below link:</p>

<ul>

</ul>


<h2><a id="useful"></a> Some Useful Tools</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/2014/07/25/logic.JPG" width="400" height="400">
<img class="center" src="/images/2014/07/25/jtagulator.JPG" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p><strong>Logic Analyzer</strong> is a good device when you have to see the signals from the pins if you don&rsquo;t have any datasheet. Put all the electrodes on each pin and measure the signal. Starting from RST, you may find right debugging interface. (I failed :/) The device on the left picture is logic analyzer from Quantasylum, you can access to it via this link:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.quantasylum.com/content/Products/QA100.aspx"><code>Device Info</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.quantasylum.com/content/Support/Downloads.aspx#QA100"><code>Drivers</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.quantasylum.com/content/Portals/0/UploadedFiles/QA100%20Documentation.pdf"><code>Documentation</code></a></li>
</ul>


<p>The device on the right is <a href="http://www.grandideastudio.com/portfolio/jtagulator/"><strong>JTAGulator</strong></a>. JTAGulator is a cool device that automatically detects UART &amp; JTAG interface.  It&rsquo;s circuit is protected, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the over-voltage. There exists 24 channels which means that you can test 24 electrodes all at once. It connects to PC with Serial, so you can just press start button and wait having a cup of coffee.</p>

<h2><a id="con"></a> Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many debugging interfaces supported by embedded devices. However, nowadays, embedded designers protect their these debugging features using password or other special input signals so-called &lsquo;Secure&rsquo;. Therefore, from now, we need to consider how we can access to right debugging interface when they are protected.</p>
